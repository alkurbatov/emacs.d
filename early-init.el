;; Tweak Emacs at the early stage to speed up loading.
;;

;;; Code:

;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

;; Do not initialise the package manager. This is done in `init.el'.
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Disable handlers and checkers for the early init stage.
(defvar file-name-handler-alist-original file-name-handler-alist)
(setq file-name-handler-alist nil)

;; Do not load customization files before early init. This is done in `init.el'.
(setq site-run-file nil)

;; Faster to disable these here (before they've been initialized)
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(push '(menu-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup times with fonts that are
;; larger than the system default.
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

(provide 'early-init)
;;; early-init.el ends here
